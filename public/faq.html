	<br><h class="faqQ">Why do I keep getting 404 errors?</h>
	<br><p class="faqA">The most likely reason is that you are entering a subdirectory that doesn't exist. Ex: pleasedontbock.me/eggs | If you know this isn't the case and it is something else, please contact me on Discord: Degenerate#0001</p>
        <br><h class="faqQ">Why is a site marked as deceptive?</h>
        <br><p class="faqA">Google will sometimes mistake a traditional site for a scam site. The best thing you can do in this situation is to report it as a mistake <a target="_blank" href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/?hl=en">here</a>, and to DM me on Discord: Degenerate#0001</p>
        <br><h class="faqQ">Where can I get more links?</h>
        <br><p class="faqA">You can get more links by clicking the "Community" button on the homepage, or by going to discord.gg/unblock. There I will have more links, and you can check out other pr<span>ox<span>y sites! :D</p>
        <br><h class="faqQ">Why is it when I click on a button, nothing happens?</h>
        <br><p class="faqA">Idk. Just press CTRL + Shift + R, and click on the button again. If this doesn't work, contact me on Discord: Degenerate#0001</p>
